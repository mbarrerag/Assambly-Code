# Assembly Code Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Assembly Code Repository. This repository contains code for two different Assembly languages: Intel Assembly and Atmega 328 Assembly.

### Intel Assembly

Intel Assembly is a low-level programming language used for programming Intel processors, such as those in the x86 and x86-64 architectures. It provides direct control over a computer's hardware resources, making it highly efficient for tasks that require fine-grained control. Intel Assembly is commonly used in operating system development, driver programming, and other system-level tasks.

Getting Started with Intel Assembly:
- Refer to the [Official Intel x86 Assembly Documentation](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-sdm.html) for comprehensive information on Intel Assembly programming.

### Atmega 328 Assembly

Atmega 328 Assembly is tailored for programming Atmel/Microchip AVR microcontrollers, with a focus on the Atmega 328 family. These microcontrollers are popular in embedded systems and IoT devices. Atmega 328 Assembly allows you to create highly optimized and efficient code for these microcontrollers, making it ideal for projects with resource constraints.

Getting Started with Atmega 328 Assembly:
- Explore the [Atmel/Microchip AVR Documentation](https://www.microchip.com/avr-support/documentation) for official resources and information on Atmega 328 Assembly programming.
